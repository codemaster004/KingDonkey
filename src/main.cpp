/*
 * ? Point 4. "The time should be displayed along with the information about implemented requirements."
 *  	- does this mean "somewhere on the screen we are supposed to display letters (A, H, D) with implemented points?
 * ? "Character movement and control parameters should be easy to change to achieve smooth control."
 *  	- what does the "to achieve smooth control." mean?
 * ? Menu: Read
 * ? Menu: Check results
 * ? Menu: Save, save what?
 * ? Is there any particular order we are supposed to complete those requirements?
 * ? Point B.c. "signal this event (continued in point D)"
 * 		- never continued, what does it mean, what should the event display/ change?
 * ? Are there any other coding restrictions other than "do not use std::"
 * ? How long may the functions/methods be? how many characters? how many lines?
 * ? Are we allowed to operate on binary files? Using of course only standard C functions.
 * ? What about global variables, can we use them? If so what types? only simple C types, ar structures as well?
 * ? If not global variables are static variables inside classes allowed?
